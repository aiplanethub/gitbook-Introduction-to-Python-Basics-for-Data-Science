# Why Python for Data Science?

* Free and open source
* Great community
* Plenty of libraries for Data Science & Machine Learning
* Easy and intuitive to use

Note:

* Data Science is not about programming languages/tools such as Python, R, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab etc
* Data Science is using above tools and techniques, and if required inventing new tools and techniques, to solve a problem using “data” in a “scientific” way.
